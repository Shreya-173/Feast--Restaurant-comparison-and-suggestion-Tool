You should never eat the food at any McDonald's, as it is so incredibly harmful to your health.

And if you do go, make sure you tell the staff how much you appreciate them... A simple thank you for all you do, or a specific compliment of any sort will make someone's day I promise. And if you really want to do something that makes a huge positive difference, take note or ask the name of the employees you interact with, then call the customer service number on the receipt and tell them how good their employees are, and how good your experience was. Never mind the food, these are the most hard-working employees that you will encounter, and they hardly ever get compliments. Calling that customer service number and giving specific names sometimes even can help get someone a raise or promotion! And to top it all off many times when you take the time to call the customer service number on the receipt, they will send you coupons to thank you for your feedback so everyone wins!

You get 6 for $6.95 if you order directly, and they are quite heavy! Their casing/shell is very thick, which may not be appealing to everyone.

I would have liked more other vegetables. However, it was fried well. 2.5/5\n\nI wish their menu described how many sauces are served with the dumplings. I thought they only served soy sauce, but they also give you a special dumpling sauce, mustard, and duck sauce. My favorite out of all is the duck sauce. It's sweet and they give you about 3 pouches. You get 1 pouch of mustard, which is too acidic and not my favorite. Their dumpling sauce seems to be homemade, and it's a good balance of salty and sweet. You also get 3 packets or so of soy sauce. No need to spend an extra 50 cents on sauce orders! And of course, they give you fortune cookies (a whole 3 for my order).\n\nAll in all, their dumplings are definitely pretty great.

We had a very awesome experience it first started from the greeting at the door by Kelsey and when she seated us she was a great hostess. We was greeted by Sarah which was our waitress. Sarah was very attentive about me and my two sisters needs.. Sarah was very professional and she has awesome listening skills. Sarah made no mistakes with the ordering. Also me and my sisters ordered six glasses of wine which was very tasty thanks to the bar staff. Also the food and the plating was beautiful no fingerprints on the plates which says alot about how y'all expedite the food before coming out of the kitchen. 3 years ago me and my sisters came there with my mom for Mother's Day brunch however my mom passed within the last 2 years.

Everything was soooo flavourful and wasn't too small portioned. I highly recommend the Chongqing dry hot chicken its one of my new favorite dishes ever. The staff are super friendly and helpful as well and made it a great experience. This is my go-to for Asian food in the burgh. Highly recommend to anyone!"", 'Not your typical American Chinese restaurant, although they do have that if you are interested. I come here for the authentic Szechuan cuisine that they offer. My hands down favorite dish is La Zi Ji (辣子鸡) which is often listed as ""Dry/Crispy Hot Chicken"". This dish is a Szechuan specialty that I\'ve had here, in San Francisco, and New York. I\'ve yet to try the dish in China, but amongst the American facsimiles that I\'ve had, this is the best one. One note that I will say is that on a recent visit this dish was quite a bit sweeter than it has been in the past, I\'m not sure if it was just an off day or what the difference was, but it was better when it wasn\'t as sweet.\n\nIn addition to the La Zi Ji, I always order the Dry Sautéed Green Beans with Pork (干煸四季豆). These green beans remain remarkably crispy, but they are also cooked through with a good amount of saltiness. You can order them without the pork if you are looking for a vegetarian option, but the pork adds a really nice flavor.\n\nLastly, when I have someone with me that can take the heat, I order the Spicy Fish Soup (水煮鱼). This is a very hot dish and can challenge the most capsaicin tolerant eaters, but it is so good. Unfortunately, they only seem to have one portion size of this soup, and it is enough for 4 or more people to enjoy in my experience. I have ordered it when there are just 2 folks that are eating, but I always end up taking some home, and this is one soup that is best when it is fresh out of the kitchen in my opinion.\n\nSo in summary, this is some of the most authentic Szechuan food that I\'ve encountered in the US. Someone that is more experienced in Szechuan food than I am can speak more to the authenticity, but for me I don\'t go anywhere else.', ""I've never eaten cumin beef like this.

But the tacos and salsa were above and beyond.\nJust as I was about to leave I was complementing one of the owners he apologized because he had forgotten to offer me the vegan dessert option… Pineapple cake. I’m dead i’m dying. I had it in a to go container and had to call them to make sure it was vegan because it was so lush and delicious. One of the owners brother-in-law is vegan and has been coaching them through recipes. The beans are vegan but the rice is not… Yet!. They seem very open to evolution over time and getting more vegan options. They are across and down the street from the Children’s Hospital. Right where Lawrenceville and Bloomfield touch. Central to a lot. Right on the corner.\nFeel lucky if you get to go.', 'It’s my first time experiencing the food at this restaurant. Check out parking coz is bit hard to find and park.

If you eat meat, order something with lots of protein and you won't be disappointed. The corn surrounding the meat was good, but was just missing something.

I asked one of the employees if they have a dining room, and if it's open and he pointed to my right -- where there was one.\n\nIt was completely empty, so it was not a problem finding a table for the four of us. Menus are already on the tables so we perused it. One side has Venezuelan dishes, the other Mexican. We focused only on the Venezuelan side as that was why we came here.\n\nWhen the owner (?) came by to get our drink order, we asked for help with the menu selections and ended getting the Venezuelan Mix appetizer, a couple of Pabellon Criollos, and the Patacones. The owner assured us this would give us a good sampling of what the cuisine is all about.\n\nThe appetizers arrived after a while and we dove in. Everything was tasy and we enjoyed them all ... but did note that everything was fried. Then, when the main dishes arrived, the same thing happened. Tasty food ad most of it was fried. We did also ask for a sample of their hot sauce since some of us like things on the hotter side.\n\nWe all thought the food was very tasty and the owner kept checking back on how we were doing. His guidance was very much appreciated. While we were there, other parties drifted in. At least one party were regulars, and another may have been Venezuelan (and were certainly Latino) and knew the menu as they did not fumble as much with it as we did!\n\nPrices were reasonable at less than $25 per person when including the appetizer, main dish, and tip.

You can order with your server but you have to pay at both the restaurant and the coffee shop.  They have hot and iced coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, and a wide variety of chorros.

The operators know about the soggy chips as they offer a disassembled nacho plate as an option. They also offer a selection of hot sauces and I opted for their hottest offering.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready and I dug into it. The low cost for the tacos was evident in both the size of them and their fillings. Flavor wise, they were just Ok. The hot sauce was basically Red Hot with a little extra Cayenne thrown in. I was disappointed in that – but I like very spicy food. If you are not very heat tolerant, it will probably serve you well.

So flavorful and cooked perfectly. I'd get a plate of just the meat and a side if I could. For $11, the portion is alright. Not too big or too small. In my opinion, they used too much lettuce. It was all jumbled together near the center, and just wasn't good. Rice was middle of the road, but well cooked. I thought there would be more cheese. Its just a few small pieces, and they don't add much flavor. Beans are tasty and seasoned well.\n\nAll in all, this place makes amazing meat. The burrito itself, though (rice and amount of lettuce) was good but not great. Churros are delicious.

Moving to the area, I saw a lot of ""Pasta Too""s products on sale at Giant Eagle. I figured that if a place sold their own sauce & pasta in stores, it would be an authentic, good place. And so I visited Pasta Too, assuming it would be great Italian food. Not quite.\n\nLet me first start with the positives: the stuffed mushroom appetizer was pretty decent. And the staff (including the various servers) were very friendly. That\'s not necessarily a given everywhere, so I feel it should be mentioned. Great staff.\n\nOkay, so for the more negative stuff. The food was bland. The pasta sauce was WAY too sweet, and tasted like Chef Boyardee. I got the Romano Chicken, and everything from the batter/breading to the actual chicken itself tasted weird. The water tasted like it came from a toilet. The salad was cold and I\'m pretty sure the salad was prepped and then left in the fridge. The eggplant parmesan tasted like it was frozen prior to being served.\n\nI originally came to Pasta Too because I saw it had a 4.5 rating and mostly good reviews. Perhaps I came on an off day. It happens. Or maybe I just have a different standard. Either way, I was left disappointed and regretted spending that much on a meal that would\'ve been 10x better at Olive Garden. I won\'t be returning, BUT I hope that everyone else has a better experience. I guess I\'m just the outlier. And again, the staff was very nice, so that\'s a good thing. I wish this restaurant the best, even after my experience.', 'Food was outstanding. Service was great. This place is HOPPING busy.

The sauce was thin with very little flavor.\n\nDisappointing that no salad came with the meal. And the “fresh, hot” bread that came out prior to the appetizer was only slightly warn.\n\nA gentleman came out to see how our meals were (we assumed he was the owner). He made every excuse about why the dishes “could have been salty” and making a scene in the restaurant. He was genuinely appalled that we were dissatisfied.

The food quality is excellent and the prices are pretty reasonable. Tonight, I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and Thai custard with sweet sticky rice.\n\nThe pad Thai itself was quite good. Some of the noodles are a bit clumped together, but that could have been just due to travel time. They use an ample amount of tofu, not too little or too much. Most of the pieces were tasty and flavorful, but a few were a bit tough. Their sauce has a slight red hue to it (similar to Thai and Noodle Outlet). But, I prefer this sauce since it's not overpoweringly sweet. Nice crunch from sprouts.Would have liked a few more peanuts or a stronger nutty flavor. Still, very good, and they read my note saying no green onions. Portion was ample, more than enough for a meal or a meal for a hungry person.\n\nTheir Thai custard was phenomenal. Local Thai places like this make amazing desserts! It tasted homemade and makes you feel warm inside. The custard was perfectly sweet, and had a slight edge which was caramelized (which was extra amazing). The rice was well cooked and soaked in coconut milk. Would have appreciated a bit more coconut milk on top. The packaging for this dessert was also interesting (a container inside the standard box).\n\nAll in all, the food at Sawasdee is delicious. They make a solid Pad Thai and the Thai custard is top notch. Prices are in line with other places and the portion sizes are ample.

The staff was hustling. There was one waitress who was handling all the table, answering the phones, and taking care of pick-up orders. Even with that workload she gave us the time we needed and answered our questions and was patient with us. She did make one mistake when she delivered our food and gave the wrong dish to the wrong person. Since we did not know any better, we started eating what she gave us. When she came back with the other dish, she immediately realized the mistake, owned up to it, and fixed it appropriately. Kudos to her for how she handled it. So, no deduction in points for that.\n\nBut, as I said, the food itself was not that interesting to my palate, nor to the others. The Lemongrass Chicken stir fry and the Bun Honey Chicken Bowls were pretty bland. Each table in the restaurant had big bottles of Sriracha and Hoisin Sauce available and we used them – liberally. Looking around at the other diners, they were using them too. However, that’s not a good thing. Our third member ordered Chicken Pho.

The meatballs were good, had some great seasonings on them, along with the bread they gave us… delicious. The Steak was a Little mediocre, as far as steaks go… but it’s on the high end of mediocre… so it’s still pretty good. Just didn’t seem to “wow” me or knock me out of my socks.

I would definitely come back and recommend if I was nearby, but it wouldn’t factor in as a “I’m gonna drive two hours to eat here”.\n\nThe staff was all very very friendly and I do think you will be seeing me again.', 'Good thing we made reservations! Parking is difficult. They have a small lot in front of the building, and a larger, gravel lot, behind the building. Both were almost completely full when we arrived. We were seated at a nice booth. Wait staff was plentiful and we were quickly offered water as well as menus. Our waitress was delightful. She has obviously been with the restaurant for a long time and knew the menu inside and out. She was attentive to us and her other tables, and took good care of all our needs. We made sure to reward her efforts in the tip we left.\n\nThe menu itself is quite extensive and features many Middle Eastern dishes. There are many American dishes for those who do not wish to indulge in that particular cuisine as well.\n\nWe started with the Mezze Platter. This was a selection of standards: Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, Grape Leaves, Tabbouli, Pita, etc. It was enough to whet our appetites, but a little scant for sharing between four people. Luckily there was more food coming. Flavors were reasonable, although the Baba Ghanouj was surprisingly sweet.\n\nAs far as the main dishes went, we went with a Mixed Kebab, a Lamb Kebab, a Flounder Mediterranean, and a baked eggplant and grape leaves meal. All of these meals come with rice and vegetable sides. You also  get a side salad, and one of us upgraded to the She Crab Soup. One of our party asked that the rice be substituted for vegetables and the waitress said that would not be a problem. When the dish came (the fish), we were surprised to note an ear of corn on the plate!\n\nAs far as the flavors of the dishes, it was very much a hit or miss affair. The She Crab Soup was judged to be excellent while all the salads were drenched in too much dressing that featured way too much oil and not enough herbs or other flavors. The grilled meats were just that – grilled meats. While the meats were grilled perfectly, they were not flavored in any way. We all expected some seasoning since those cuisines typically use a lot of herbs. The saving grace was that each of the Kebabs came with a small tub of a lemony dip which we were able to dunk the meat cubes into.\n\nThe fish was cooked perfectly and was seasoned well. At one point it was coated in bread crumbs, but then it was placed in a sauce so the bread crumbs did not retain their crunch and became soggy. Too bad. It would have been better to not have the bread crumbs at all. Unfortunately, the spinach and tomatoes that were part of the dish were just laid on top or bottom and did not contribute to the dish. This is also where that mysterious ear of corn appeared. It was way overcooked in plain boiling water. Not only was it tasteless, but you could scrape the cob and get corn soup from it. We left it uneaten. The baked eggplant was very tasty and the grape leaves that came with it were the same grape leaves that came with the Mezze Platter.\n\nThe veggies that came with most of our dishes on the side included Broccoli and Green Beans as well as rice. Again, there was no seasoning on any of them. They were cooked well, but had almost no flavor to them whatsoever.\n\nAs you can see, this was a very uneven experience. We’ve eaten at many Mediterranean restaurants around Pittsburgh, in other parts of the country, and even in the Middle East. It is not easy to figure out where to place this one. It is clearly not one of our favorites, but there is so much good going on here that it is a shame to downrate it completely. On the other hand, there are so many problems, that it is difficult to give it a very high rating either. I ended up deciding on a three-star rating to recognize the excellent points and the incredible wait staff as counterbalancing the weak points from the kitchen staff. Our meals, which included a bottle of wine, ended up costing $50 per person, which is on the pricey side for what we got – which was the final consideration.', ""I tripped over this place coming home from work ...

Borek was a decent size and the feta tastes delicious. The ends, however, were not completely filled with cheese in all of the pieces. The Pide Efes has a lot of meat and is decently spiced but nothing counteracts the flavor and it has an odd aftertaste. The Pide with cheese was greasy but had a thinish crust, a bit bland. Side salads are mediocre, do not count on them being more than lettuce with a few veggies.\n\nI have previously tried their Margarita pizza, baklava, falafel, cheesecake, and mushroom and ricotta pizza. Their personal pies are a bit pricey, and so are the larger options (even without taking toppings into consideration). Ricotta came in small blobs but was quite tasty, and the pizza wasn't greasy but was crusty. Baklava was well soaked and very sweet while the cheesecake was tasty+well portioned as well. Falafel was on the crunchy side but had a great portion."", 'Ordered the Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dates - it was great! Spicy but sweet also - unique blend of flavors.

The owner made us feel welcomed and I can't wait to come back to this beautiful restaurant."", 'I was very excited to see the return of Khalil\'s. This restaurant has always had a very special place in my heart. I was first introduced to Khalil\'s by my grandmother who spent many years working in the Middle East. Khalil\'s reminded her of all the warm and wonderful people who made her long trips abroad so much more bearable. It was not just the high quality of food. It was the high caliber of people who made the restaurant a welcoming place.\n\nEventually Khalil\'s became a place I made my own memories with my own family. My fondest memory is when I was all done being pregnant with my son. I would come in, and they would laugh and say eat this Sleek to have a good labor. I am happy to report I had the easiest 3-hour labor in the world. I am sure it has something to do with the Sleek.\n\nI was sad when they went on hiatus. This is a family business. They chose to close down for a few months in order to rally around the wonderful patriarch whose dream had provided so much for his family and the community. A few months turned into a few years.\n\nI\'m thrilled to report that not much has changed since 1980\'s. After all, the food has always been on point. The Mezza platters are extraordinarily beautiful and delicious starts to meal. I had the one with Falafel and the spanakopita.  The falafel is crunchy, spicy, loaded with just the right amount of tahini, and chickpeas. The spanakopita is light and buttery and crunchy crispy deliciousness. It is served on a tasty bed of lettuce and drizzled with excellent feta cheese. I think the baba ganoush is not as smokey as it used to be. Maybe I\'m older. Maybe it needs a little more smoke. The hummus is always the right perfectly creamy texture. All of this is served surrounded by Syrian pickles and crunchy vegetables. There really isn\'t a ""garnish"" on the plate it all works together in a synchronous deliciousness.\n\nOf course, I had the Sleek. As always, the Black Eyed Peas are the perfect texture, not too soft and bushy. The Bulgur wheat is flavorful without being overbearing. The onions are fried to a perfect crispy gloriousness. And all combined together with the kale it makes for a most satisfying meal with their signature rice pilaf. The rice pilaf is always served with freshly roasted almonds garnished on top, which makes it feel extra special.\n\nMy husband had the lamb shank. It is served also with the rice pilaf. It is a hearty filling meal. Be prepared to to be absolutely satiated.\n\nMy son had the chicken kebab. He\'s a little bit picky, since I do a lot of cooking at home. But, he cleaned his plate. Tender pieces of chicken are spread  over a lovely bed of the rice pilaf. Each piece is perfectly seasoned.\n\nAll of the meals come with the Khalil\'s signature salad. I kind of miss the iceberg lettuce. But I am not unhappy with seasonal mixed greens. I understand times change.  People want more from their lettuce leaf these days. It doesn\'t matter what kind of lettuce they make the salad with, as long as it comes with their special homemade dressing. And it does!  That has not changed.\n\nI think they are still finding their rhythm. It\'s hard to do something new when you have so much history behind you. I\'m just glad to have been part of the story for as long as I have. And I hope you have an opportunity to join in. It\'s a nice place to go and feel welcome and at home.', ""A Middle Eastern restaurant in the heart of Shadyside.

One of our acquaintances suggested that this place had more than just the standard Japanese Steakhouse offerings, so we checked out the menu, saw that was indeed the case, and decided to try them out.\n\nBeing the middle of the week, the place was busy but we were still seated right away. We thought that would be a good sign. Our waitress showed up right away and asked for a drink order, then came back quickly with waters. However, the first oddity of the night happened right then. She basically disappeared. We waited for over 30 minutes for her to come back with the one water glass she forgot and to take our order. She was still there, she just managed to constantly ignore our table and turn around and walk the other way every time she passed by. Now, the restaurant was not THAT busy, nor was it understaffed. Eventually, one of the other waitstaff noticed that we were just sitting there and asked us about it. We mentioned that we were not sure what was going on and she got our waitress to come back. From that point on there was no problem with the service, but that was odd, and it cost this place on star on this review.\n\nThe menu does have the standards. But we came to try other things so we focused on those. We ordered the grilled beef dish, a Udon dish, the Red Snapper soup, and a couple of Sushi rolls since the people who recommended this place raved about it. We also looked over their surprisingly large wine list and ordered a Sake tasting and a bottle of Riesling.\n\nHere came the other oddity of the night. The order in which the dishes arrived was perplexing. First came the Miso soup that came with the beef dish and the salad that came with the Udon. Then came the Red Snapper soup, the Udon itself, and the beef. Only finally did the Sushi arrive. What's with that? We stated that we were going to share the sushi as the appetizer between us? There goes another star.\n\nNow on to the taste. The bottom line is that everything was just average. We've had better sushi at other places in town. The Red Snapper soup had one small piece of fish in a very salty broth (see picture for the one piece we found). The Udon was a very generous bowl of soup... not what we envisioned from the description. And so on. So, overall, not a bad meal and experience... just average.

So I thought I would share that in case it was helpful to others in my situation. I think many other fish might be as well. I will need to ask again. The owner said that due to covid and supply chain issues, they opted for the farm raised salmon. I did find out that the wasabi is gluten free as well, so that's a plus!

The neon beer signs in the windows and the old furniture is less than inspiring. You get sort of a grimey feeling being there.\n\nNext, service service, service. I think our waitress needs to have retraining sessions. She was fairly rude, and seemed to ignore us quite a bit. Perhaps it's because it was somewhat busy at first but even later when there was hardly anyone she was still very rude and seemed to ignore us. There were also a lot of serving faux pas like reaching across the whole table rather than moving to the other side which was open and many more things to be improved on.\n\nThe mixed drinks were okay but not great. Little too much juice or too sweet but they were pretty. Get it for the Gram. I got the pain killer and my life still has a lot of pain in it so that's just false advertising.\n\nWe got the veal and scallop hibachi meal. Gotta say, for $30 it's a pretty sad amount of meat. It's only 4 scallops and not much more veal. It was mostly veggies and rice and neither were that great. We had to get it redone the first time (why yes, we are fun at parties) because not only was the veal not even close to medium rare it was charred and very tough, tasted burnt. When we got it back however, I gotta say the new veal was quite good. It was an incredible improvement being well seasoned and tender.\n\nThe samurai sushi special roll was indeed special. It had this creamy, almost buttery taste and texture. I couldn't get enough of it and I found it to be quite good. This review would have gotten 2 stars if it wasn't for the sushi.

In a big square, everything touching. Then use that same tool to handle vegetables, rice, and noodles, then insert that tool into ready to eat products.

But instead of using real fresh wasabi from Japanese horseradish, the wasabi provided is definitely not real fresh wasabi. They taste more similar to the wasabi in a tube found in supermarkets and cheap sushi places. Real wasabi has a mild taste and a hint of sweetness, but fake wasabi (horseradish) is very strong and has no hint of sweetness. The difference is night and day. For $135 omakase, and they claim to serve the freshest ingredients, this is completely unacceptable.\n2) Of the 11 courses, over half of them are a plate of 3 pieces of sashimi with sauce. Though the sauces are slightly different, the overall taste is too heavy and I'm left with just the taste of sauce and not the fish.\n3) they didn't have any good traditional omakase pieces; their tuna and fatty tuna are not well prepared and the taste leaves a lot to be desired.\n4) no uni (sea urchin)\n5) they served white tuna (escolar), an oily fish that is illegal in Japan due to its high oil content and consuming a lot of it can cause diarrhea.\n\nOverall, my experience is meh. The service was great but the food is just horrible, definitely not worth the price!!!\n\nHowever, their dessert is truly creative and is the best part of the meal.\n\nIf you are coming for experience, I recommend the 7 course for everyone who wants to try it since it contains the best parts of the meal.

The truffle was too dominant, and the tastes were just not balanced.\nTo top it off, both the Riesling and the $82 bottle of Sancerre were rather bland and so completely devoid of character that they could not pair well with any of the food.\n\nService was good, it was not her fault that the food was terrible.', ""The ambience and vibe of Umi is top notch, walking up the stairs passed all of the cool wall art is exciting and then you get up to what feels like a fancy hidden gem.

From the outside, it does look like a small, hole in the wall place. The inside is pretty unassuming, too. However, this seems like a family run place which is always great. I ordered a shredded chicken empanada, 2 shredded beef empanadas, a cachapa, choriqueso empanada, and churros. I really quite liked everything!\n\nFirst of all, I account capitalize the value you get for this place. These empanadas are hefty and can make a decent meal in and of themselves. I especially recommend this spot if you are a student. The shredded beef empanadas were definitely my favorites. It was flavorful, filling, and the corn was not too gritty. In fact, it was more silky.\n\nThe shredded chicken was also great. Neither of the meat based empanadas had chewy beef. The meat was tender and delicious. I took a risk with the choriqueso empanada, and had mixed feelings about it. If you like chorizo, definitely give it a try, since it is full of chorizo! However, I never tried chorizo, so it was an odd flavor. The cheese was great, though. The garlic sauce was tasty, and so was the pink sauce, and it is a bit sweet. The sauce portions are small but one sauce comes free with each item.\n\nThe cachapa was a bit sweeter than I expected (comparing it to Cilantro and Ajo), but was still very good. It's a little small but also very inexpensive. I ordered the plain version and thought the cheese was delicious, and it had a ton of cheese. The churros were quite good as well (first time having churros). They made them right in front of me as I was picking up the order. You get 6 and a choice of sauce. They were still warm, but a bit too hard. There wasn't a whole lot of sauce on them, too, but they were still soft and tasty in the inside.\n\nOverall, this is a great value place and there is a decently large menu. Seems like an authentic Venezuelan place. I recommend trying the beef empanadas most!"", ""Got some arepas and empanadas to go. Most items are $5-10. They heat up the corn cakes on the griddle and stuff them according to order.\n\nThe chorizo is a little greasy and messy but that's probably what makes it taste so good!"", ""Delicious!
